# CS594 - Signal Protocol

I'm using macOS, so the easy way to install Python 3 is by using `brew`:

```
brew install python
```

We need to have the `cryptography` and `pycryptodome` libraries installed. Use `pip3` to install them:

```
pip3 install cryptography
pip3 install pycryptodome
```

## How to Run the Program

Open three terminal windows for `server`, `alice`, and `bob`, and follow these steps:

1. Run the server first: `python3 server.py`
2. Run the Alice side: `python3 alice.py`
3. Run the Bob side: `python3 bob.py`
4. Remember, Alice sends the message first.
